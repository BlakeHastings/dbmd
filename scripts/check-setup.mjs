// Which enforcement layers this repo actually has, and which it only has
// instructions about.
//
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
// The layers in references/enforcement.md get installed by copying files and
// wiring two of them up, and none of that is self-verifying. A repo with
// guard-merge.mjs sitting in scripts/ and no hook entry in settings.json looks
// exactly like a repo that is protected, right up until an agent merges. In one
// project the setup was never done at all: 20 merges went through raw
// `gh pr merge`, one of them landing a PR whose main check was still pending.
// The setup section had been read at turn one. Reading it is not doing it.
//
// So setup ends with printed output instead of with a table having been read.
// Run this before installing anything and every layer that applies reports
// MISSING; install, run it again, and paste both. It exits non-zero until each
// of those is present AND wired, because wiring is the half that gets skipped.
// Re-run it after any change to the hook settings or to CI job names, where the
// same layers go quiet without going away.
//
// WHICH LAYERS APPLY IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE WRITE BOUNDARY
// ADR 0021 splits the factory in two by what it may write to, and the layers
// are not the same set on both sides. The four numbered below are owned mode's,
// and every one of them is a change to a repository you are allowed to change.
// Guest mode has one control instead, `guard-guest-writes.mjs`, installed into
// untracked local files, and installing any of the other four into somebody
// else's repository is the thing guest mode exists in order not to do.
//
// So this reports the layers that apply to the mode it is in, and explains an
// absent layer by the mode rather than listing it as a failure. A permanently
// red line is the same failure as a guard that cries wolf: both get switched
// off, and this repository already spends its one tolerable permanently-red
// line on layer 3 under ADR 0001.
//
// There are three states rather than two: owned, guest, and nobody having said.
// The third is a finding rather than an error. ADR 0021 has the question asked
// out loud at initialisation, so a repository where nobody wrote the answer down
// skipped the step. That is worth printing, and it is not a reason to fail a
// setup that is otherwise complete.
//
// This also writes the owned answer, with `--record-owned`, because until #100
// nothing could: the guest record is written by installing the gate, and owned
// has no gate to install. See that section below for why the reader of a fact
// is a defensible place to keep its writer.

// --record-owned, which is the answer this repository could not produce
//
// ADR 0021 calls the write boundary a machine fact **either way**, and has the
// question asked out loud at initialisation. Only one thing ever wrote that
// fact, `guard-guest-writes.mjs --install`, and it only ever writes `guest`,
// because installing the gate *is* the guest declaration (ADR 0029). So the two
// states a repository reached on its own were guest and unrecorded, and an
// owned repository printed NOT RECORDED for ever while being told to write a
// line nothing could write. ADR 0029's own rule about remedies applies to a
// report as well as to a gate: a wall with a signpost pointing nowhere is how a
// layer gets switched off.
//
// The cost is worse than a wasted paragraph, and it is the reason this exists
// rather than the output simply being softened. NOT RECORDED means two things
// at once: **nobody asked**, which is the state ADR 0021's asymmetry is built
// to catch, and **asked, answered owned, nowhere to put it**, which is fine. A
// state every owned repository is permanently in carries no signal. Softening
// the text instead would have made silence mean owned, and silence meaning
// owned is the one inference ADR 0021 forbids: "no record" is a fact about the
// repository in exactly the way "no gate installed" is, and a work repository
// with nothing set up yet looks precisely like an owned one.
//
// **The writer lives beside the reader**, which is the same argument ADR 0027
// makes for the probe and the rule being one file. The one thing the two halves
// must agree on is the shape of the `Write boundary:` line, and here they cannot
// disagree. Guest keeps its own writer, because there the record is a byproduct
// of installing the gate, and a guest record written without the gate is a
// declaration with nothing behind it.
//
// **It writes the record and excludes it, and does nothing else.** No gate, no
// hook, no settings file: owned mode has no boundary to hold. A misfire in a
// repository that is not yours therefore writes one untracked file that makes
// this report say `owned`, which is already the checklist it reports when
// nobody has recorded anything, and it cannot touch the gate, which never reads
// the mode.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// What an owned record says, which is nearly all reason and one fact. There is
// no owned equivalent of the guest record's backlog line or probe command: in
// owned mode the backlog and the check command are repo facts, true for anyone
// who clones, and they belong in a committed `AGENTS.md`. The boundary is the
// only machine fact owned mode has, so this file is thin on purpose, and its
// worth is that it exists rather than what it holds.
const OWNED_RECORD = `# Machine facts

Not committed, and not committable. ADR 0021 splits the initialisation answers
by who they are about: repo facts are true for anyone who clones and belong in
\`AGENTS.md\`, and machine facts are about *this* operator on *this*
repository. This file is the second kind, and it is inside the git common
directory rather than in the working tree, so nobody who clones this repository
inherits it, no ignore rule has to hold it out of anybody's \`git status\`, and
every linked worktree reads the same copy. ADR 0037.

Write boundary: owned

The factory may write outward from here: create the repository, seed a backlog,
push branches, open and merge pull requests, configure CI, apply a ruleset.

That is the whole of the answer, and the file is short because owned mode has
one machine fact and no gate to hold it. The guest record names a gate to probe
at this point. What there is to ask here is the owned enforcement stack, which
answers a different question: what may land, rather than what may be written
outward.
