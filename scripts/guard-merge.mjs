// PreToolUse guard: nothing reaches the default branch except through the
// sanctioned path.
//
// SETUP
// One knob: DEFAULT_BRANCH, below. Set it to this repository's default branch
// if it is not `main`. `check-setup.mjs` compares the two and reports a
// mismatch, because a guard protecting a branch that does not exist is a guard
// that protects nothing while looking installed.
//
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
// Branch protection needs a paid plan on a private repo, so GitHub will happily
// accept a merge with CI red, or a direct push to the default branch that skips
// review entirely. Agents run unattended, and "I was told not to" is not a
// control. This is the control.
//
// It denies, before the command runs: `gh pr merge`, a merge through `gh api`,
// and a `git push` whose own arguments name the default branch as the
// destination. The permitted route is `node scripts/merge-pr.mjs <n>`, which
// verifies every required check is green and then squash-merges. That command
// does not match anything below, and the `gh api` call it makes internally is a
// child process rather than a Bash tool call, so the guard does not see it.
// Making the safe path the only working path beats asking nicely.
//
// ASK IT WHETHER IT IS LOADED
// A hook is written into settings, loaded by a process at startup, and fires on
// a command. Only the third of those denies anything, and the middle one is
// invisible from inside: a gate that was never loaded is silent in exactly the
// way a gate with nothing to deny is silent. The repository that ships this file
// lost two days to that. Its CLI process started three hours before the hook
// existed, so the guard was never in that process's snapshot, never fired once,
// and nothing anywhere said so. The script was correct the whole time.
//
// So this file answers the question by refusing it:
//
//   node scripts/guard-merge.mjs --probe
//
// Being refused is the answer you want. The rule below denies that line by name,
// so the harness prints this guard's own message and the probe never runs. If
// you see the probe's output instead, nothing intercepted it and the guard is
// not in this process. Absence is the signal, and there is no artifact to go
// stale the way a heartbeat file would.
//
// Ask after installing, after any change to hook settings, and when you take
// over a session. `check-setup.mjs` answers a different question, whether the
// hook is *configured*, and configured, loaded and firing are three states.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
// Any session the harness did not load it into at startup, and everything that
// process spawns for as long as it lives. Any human at a terminal. CI. A net,
// not a guarantee, and one whose absence is silent — which is why layer 3, the
// provenance audit, ships beside it.
//
// It also reads only what the command line says: a merge assembled from a
// variable, a base64 `-EncodedCommand`, or a script file the command merely
// names is invisible to it, and no amount of pattern work changes that.
//
// Nor does it cover a command that runs another command, or `gh` reached under
// another name. Every line below was run against this guard and allowed
// through, and `gh pr merge` with no argument merges the current branch's pull
// request, so each of them is a working merge:
//
//   sudo gh pr merge      env gh pr merge       command gh pr merge
//   nohup gh pr merge     xargs gh pr merge     time -p gh pr merge
//   \gh pr merge          /usr/bin/gh pr merge
//
// They are left open on purpose. The threat model is an agent that forgot, or
// that talked itself into it, not one that is hiding, and nobody reaches for
// `sudo` to land a pull request by accident. The set of programs that can launch
// another program has no edge, so closing six of them buys a longer list rather
// than a closed hole, and it buys that at the cost of this section's accuracy,
// which is the part of the file worth the most.
//
// Shell *syntax* an ordinary command can contain is a different matter: it is a
// closed set, and it is covered. See LEADING_WORDS and ASSIGNMENT.
//
// One push form is open and named rather than half-closed: `git push --all` and
// `git push --mirror` write every branch, including this one, and neither says
// so on the command line in a way this guard reads. Layer 3 is what catches it.
//
// THE BRANCH-DEPENDENT RULES ARE GONE, DELIBERATELY
// Earlier copies of this file shelled out to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
// and denied a bare `git push` or any `git merge` when the answer was the
// default branch. That clause is removed, and the reason is a property of the
// mechanism rather than of any one repository: **a PreToolUse hook runs before
// its command**, so a `cd` in that command has not happened yet, and the
// directory the hook reads may not be the one the command lands in. Measured, in
// the repository that ships this: run from inside a git worktree, that clause
// answered `allow` on a command the main checkout denied. Same script, opposite
// verdict, decided by which copy of the tree the hook happened to look at.
//
// A rule that is right or wrong depending on something it cannot see is worse
// than an absent one, because it is trusted. What is left reads only the command
// line, so it gives the same answer everywhere.
//
// The cost is real and it is named above: a bare `git push` while standing on
// the default branch is not refused here. Layer 3 detects it, and detection is
// what makes prevention honest. See references/enforcement.md.
//
// HOW IT READS A COMMAND
// It asks what each command in the line *invokes*, never what the line's text
// contains. Scanning the text is a defect this guard shipped with: within
// seconds of firing for the first time it denied a `gh issue comment` whose body
// quoted the blocked command inside a markdown table. Nothing was being merged.
// Recording that the guard worked was the first thing it refused to allow.
//
// A gap lets a merge through; a false positive gets the guard switched off, and
// the second is the likelier failure. Weigh them that way when you edit this.

// The one thing to edit. `check-setup.mjs` reads this line by name.
