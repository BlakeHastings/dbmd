// PreToolUse guard: nothing reaches the default branch except through the
// sanctioned path.
//
// SETUP
// One knob: DEFAULT_BRANCH, below. Set it to this repository's default branch
// if it is not `main`. `check-setup.mjs` compares the two and reports a
// mismatch, because a guard protecting a branch that does not exist is a guard
// that protects nothing while looking installed.
//
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
// Branch protection needs a paid plan on a private repo, so GitHub will happily
// accept a merge with CI red, or a direct push to the default branch that skips
// review entirely. Agents run unattended, and "I was told not to" is not a
// control. This is the control.
//
// It denies, before the command runs: `gh pr merge`, a merge through `gh api`,
// and a `git push` whose own arguments name the default branch as the
// destination. The permitted route is `node scripts/merge-pr.mjs <n>`, which
// verifies every required check is green and then squash-merges. That command
// does not match anything below, and the `gh api` call it makes internally is a
// child process rather than a Bash tool call, so the guard does not see it.
// Making the safe path the only working path beats asking nicely.
//
// ASK IT WHETHER IT IS LOADED
// A hook is written into settings, loaded by a process at startup, and fires on
// a command. Only the third of those denies anything, and the middle one is
// invisible from inside: a gate that was never loaded is silent in exactly the
// way a gate with nothing to deny is silent. The repository that ships this file
// lost two days to that. Its CLI process started three hours before the hook
// existed, so the guard was never in that process's snapshot, never fired once,
// and nothing anywhere said so. The script was correct the whole time.
//
// So this file answers the question by refusing it:
//
//   node scripts/guard-merge.mjs --probe
//
// Being refused is the answer you want. The rule below denies that line by name,
// so the harness prints this guard's own message and the probe never runs. If
// you see the probe's output instead, nothing intercepted it and the guard is
// not in this process. Absence is the signal, and there is no artifact to go
// stale the way a heartbeat file would.
//
// Ask after installing, after any change to hook settings, and when you take
// over a session. `check-setup.mjs` answers a different question, whether the
// hook is *configured*, and configured, loaded and firing are three states.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
// Any session the harness did not load it into at startup, and everything that
// process spawns for as long as it lives. Any human at a terminal. CI. A net,
// not a guarantee, and one whose absence is silent — which is why layer 3, the
// provenance audit, ships beside it.
//
// It also reads only what the command line says: a merge assembled from a
// variable, a base64 `-EncodedCommand`, or a script file the command merely
// names is invisible to it, and no amount of pattern work changes that.
//
// Nor does it cover a command that runs another command, or `gh` reached under
// another name. Every line below was run against this guard and allowed
// through, and `gh pr merge` with no argument merges the current branch's pull
// request, so each of them is a working merge:
//
//   sudo gh pr merge      env gh pr merge       command gh pr merge
//   nohup gh pr merge     xargs gh pr merge     time -p gh pr merge
//   \gh pr merge          /usr/bin/gh pr merge
//
// They are left open on purpose. The threat model is an agent that forgot, or
// that talked itself into it, not one that is hiding, and nobody reaches for
// `sudo` to land a pull request by accident. The set of programs that can launch
// another program has no edge, so closing six of them buys a longer list rather
// than a closed hole, and it buys that at the cost of this section's accuracy,
// which is the part of the file worth the most.
//
// Shell *syntax* an ordinary command can contain is a different matter: it is a
// closed set, and it is covered. See LEADING_WORDS and ASSIGNMENT.
//
// One push form is open and named rather than half-closed: `git push --all` and
// `git push --mirror` write every branch, including this one, and neither says
// so on the command line in a way this guard reads. Layer 3 is what catches it.
//
// THE BRANCH-DEPENDENT RULES ARE GONE, DELIBERATELY
// Earlier copies of this file shelled out to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
// and denied a bare `git push` or any `git merge` when the answer was the
// default branch. That clause is removed, and the reason is a property of the
// mechanism rather than of any one repository: **a PreToolUse hook runs before
// its command**, so a `cd` in that command has not happened yet, and the
// directory the hook reads may not be the one the command lands in. Measured, in
// the repository that ships this: run from inside a git worktree, that clause
// answered `allow` on a command the main checkout denied. Same script, opposite
// verdict, decided by which copy of the tree the hook happened to look at.
//
// A rule that is right or wrong depending on something it cannot see is worse
// than an absent one, because it is trusted. What is left reads only the command
// line, so it gives the same answer everywhere.
//
// The cost is real and it is named above: a bare `git push` while standing on
// the default branch is not refused here. Layer 3 detects it, and detection is
// what makes prevention honest. See references/enforcement.md.
//
// HOW IT READS A COMMAND
// It asks what each command in the line *invokes*, never what the line's text
// contains. Scanning the text is a defect this guard shipped with: within
// seconds of firing for the first time it denied a `gh issue comment` whose body
// quoted the blocked command inside a markdown table. Nothing was being merged.
// Recording that the guard worked was the first thing it refused to allow.
//
// A gap lets a merge through; a false positive gets the guard switched off, and
// the second is the likelier failure. Weigh them that way when you edit this.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// APPENDED IN THIS CHECKOUT, 2026-09-08. THE SECTION ABOVE IS NOT EDITED.
//
// The header above arrives with the `orchestrated-delivery` skill and is the
// asset's, so it is appended to rather than corrected, the way this repository
// appends to a superseded decision record. Everything in this block is about
// this checkout and belongs to ADR 0098.
//
// WHAT WAS ADDED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF RULE AS THE ONES ABOVE
// The rules above refuse a merge, which can be reverted. Below them now sit
// rules that refuse a tag push, `npm publish`, and a release cut through `gh`,
// none of which can. `npm unpublish` is refused outright after 72 hours, and in
// this repository a `v*` tag is what starts the publish, so the tag push is the
// irreversible act wearing a push's clothes. Measured on 2026-09-08, before
// those rules existed: of 25 command lines driven through this file, the 13
// denied were every merge and every push to `main`, and the four that were
// allowed were `git tag v0.1.0`, `git push origin v0.1.0`,
// `git push origin --tags` and `npm publish`. The guard refused the reversible
// thing and permitted the permanent one. ADR 0098 is that record.
//
// `git tag` itself is still allowed, on purpose. It writes a ref inside this
// checkout, `git tag -d` removes it, and telling a creating `git tag` from a
// listing one needs a table of git's flags this file declines to keep anywhere
// else: `git tag --points-at HEAD` is a read whose argument looks exactly like a
// name to create. The push is where the consequence is, and the push is what is
// refused. ADR 0098 argues both sides of that.
//
// TWO THINGS IN THE SECTION ABOVE THAT ARE NO LONGER TRUE, REPORTED NOT FIXED
// NOT COVERED lists `\gh pr merge` and `/usr/bin/gh pr merge` as allowed through.
// Both are denied today, and were before this change: `commandName` splits on
// both separators and drops the leading `\`. Those two lines are the asset's to
// correct, and editing them here would be reverted by the next install.
//
// The same section names `git push --mirror` as open. It is open against the
// *branch* rule, which is what that paragraph is about, and it is closed against
// the tag rule below, because `--mirror` writes `refs/tags/*` and one of those
// tags publishes.
//
// THE WRAPPER WORDS ARE NOT A GAP LEFT HERE. THEY ARE A DECISION MADE ABOVE
// `command gh pr merge` and `env gh pr merge` still get through, and so does
// `env npm publish`. That is the exclusion NOT COVERED states in its own words,
// with a threat model: this guard is for an agent that forgot, not one that is
// hiding, and the set of programs that launch another program has no edge. It
// still holds under the tag and publish rules, and the forgetting-shaped
// spelling of a publish is `npm publish`, which is now refused. Widening it was
// measured and refused in ADR 0098; `test/guards/broken-on-purpose.test.ts` pins
// the exclusion as a passing assertion so it stays visible.

// The one thing to edit. `check-setup.mjs` reads this line by name.

// BEGIN command reader
//
// THIS REGION IS A COPY, AND NOTHING HERE CHECKS IT
// Everything between this marker and END arrived with this file, which the
// `orchestrated-delivery` skill installs. The same reader is carried in three
// files in that skill's own repository, and a test there runs all three over one
// corpus so that a drift between them is a red test rather than a lucky reading.
// That test does not know this file exists. It reads three paths, all of them
// upstream. Ours is a fourth copy, and the authority for what it should say is
// the skill's asset, not this repository.
//
// The comment that used to sit here claimed the test held this region. It did
// not, and the copy went a generation behind while the claim stayed. Upstream
// rewrote the reader to record whether a command is one the line runs or one a
// `$(...)` runs to produce an argument, and this copy still split a substitution
// off as a command beside its parent. The verdicts happened to agree on every
// form anyone had thought to try, which is what let it sit unnoticed. See
// ADR 0059.
//
// NO LOCAL DRIFT CHECK, DELIBERATELY
// A hash of this region vendored beside it compares this copy against this
// repository's own expectation, and would have stayed green for the whole gap:
// nothing here edited the region, upstream moved and this did not. Fetching the
// asset during `npm run check` would catch it, and puts a network call inside
// `prepublishOnly`, so a release fails when GitHub is slow and the question the
// check answers becomes "is this tree good and is the internet up". `docs/ci.md`
// already makes that argument about a moving dependency resolved at run time.
// The detection belongs upstream, where every copy is visible, and it is filed
// there.
//
// COMPARING IT BY HAND
// There is no command for this, and doing it takes a minute. Lift BEGIN to END
// out of this file and out of the skill's `assets/guard-merge.mjs`, drop
// whole-line comments and blank lines from both, and diff what is left. That
// normalisation is the one the upstream test uses, and it is why this comment
// can differ from the one shipped in the asset without reading as a drift. It
// has to differ: the asset's version calls the file it sits in "this asset" and
// names a sibling test by a path that resolves only upstream, and both of those
// are false in an installed copy.
//
// Editing the code below in this checkout is yours to do, and it makes this file
// a fork rather than an install. Say so here if you do, because the paragraph
// above is what the next reader will act on.

// Characters that end one command and begin another when they are not inside
// quotes. A closing `)` is handled separately, because ending the command is
// only half of what it does: when a `$(` opened one, it also restores the
// quote that `$(` interrupted.

// resolves the script. Ending the outer command at the `$(` instead put `node`

// Does this push put a tag on the remote? A tag matching `v*` starts

// command that makes a permanent thing happen and it reads as an ordinary push.
//
// Three readings, and only the first two are certain from the line alone.
//
// `--tags` and `--follow-tags` say it outright. So does `--mirror`, which writes
// `refs/tags/*` along with everything else; the section above names `--all` and
// `--mirror` as open against the *branch* rule and that stays true, because
// neither says on the command line which branches it carries. Which tags it
// carries is not the question here: it carries all of them, and one of those
// publishes.
//
// A refspec naming `refs/tags/` says it outright too, on either side of the
// colon, and so does git's `git push <remote> tag <name>` form.
//
// The third is a guess and is named as one. `git push origin v0.1.0` is a tag
// push or a branch push depending on what `v0.1.0` is in the repository, and
// this guard reads only the command line. A destination shaped like `v` and a
// digit is the shape this project's releases take and the shape the workflow
// triggers on, so it is refused. The cost is that a branch called `v2-spike`
// cannot be pushed under that name, which is the safe direction and the one a
// refusal message can explain.
//
// A tag whose name is neither of those, `rehearsal-1` say, reads as a branch and
// is allowed. That is deliberate rather than an edge left ragged: a tag matching
// neither `v*` nor `refs/tags/` cannot start `release.yml`, so the consequence
// this rule exists for is absent, and refusing every bare refspec would refuse
// every ordinary branch push.
//
// A delete is allowed for the same reason and one more. It cannot publish, and
// `.github/workflows/rehearse-release-ancestry.yml` documents
// `git push origin :refs/tags/rehearsal-1` as the cleanup of a procedure this
// repository runs on purpose. A guard that refuses the tidying half of a written
