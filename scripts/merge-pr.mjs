// The only sanctioned way to land a PR on the default branch.
//
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
// GitHub cannot enforce required checks here: branch protection needs a paid
// plan on a private repo. Without enforcement, "check the run first" is a
// habit, and habits lapse exactly when things are busy. This does the check
// mechanically and refuses otherwise.
//
// It also refuses a branch whose green is stale. A rollup is a fact about the
// branch as it was; the question at merge time is whether those checks are
// green on the MERGE RESULT, which is the same distinction reviewing.md makes
// for human reviewers. One repository learned this the loud way: the wrapper
// printed "All 2 required checks green. Squash merging..." and GitHub answered
// "2 of 2 required status checks are expected. (HTTP 405)" — the checks had run
// against the branch's original base and main had moved. Where a ruleset
// requires up-to-date branches, that ruleset catches it. Here nothing else
// does: the merge succeeds and the untested combination is what ships.
//
// Always squash: one issue becomes one commit on main, so `git log --oneline`
// stays a readable list of changes rather than a wall of "fix lint" noise, and
// reverting a change means reverting one commit.
//

//   gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup[].name'
// A name that never appears is treated as "never ran" and refuses the merge.
