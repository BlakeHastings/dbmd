// Two hooks about one file: the handoff the orchestrator keeps topped up, and
// what happens to it when the context window is compacted.
//
// SETUP
// Three knobs, below: HANDOFF, DEFAULT_BRANCH, and the two staleness numbers.
// Wire both events to this same file; it decides which one it is from the
// payload. The block is in references/continuity.md.
//
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
// A compaction is the one event that destroys the orchestrator's working memory
// without failing. The summariser keeps the gist and loses the specifics, and
// the specifics — which agent is on which issue, what the owner said an hour
// ago, which assumption a brief was written under — are exactly what nobody can
// reconstruct from the repository afterwards. The loop then continues,
// confidently, on a version of the state that is smoothed over.
//
// So: the handoff is a file, the file survives compaction losslessly, and
// SessionStart puts it back into the resumed context.
//
// THE HOOK CANNOT WRITE THE HANDOFF, AND THAT DECIDES THE DESIGN
// A hook is a shell command. It has stdout, stderr and an exit code. It cannot
// call a tool, run a slash command, or make the model do anything. Only the
// conversation can write prose, so a hook's whole vocabulary here is *refuse*
// and *inject*. This file does one of each.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART: `manual` MAY BE REFUSED, `auto` MAY
// NOT
// A `PreCompact` hook that exits 2 blocks the compaction. Measured on Claude
// Code 2.1.228, both triggers, and the two answers are not the same:
//
//   manual  Refused, and the harness prints this hook's stderr. The
//           orchestrator writes the handoff and runs /compact again. A gate
//           whose only cost is doing the thing it asked for.
//
//   auto    Refused too — and there is no way out. The session keeps growing,
//           the next request comes back "Prompt is too long", and the hook goes
//           on firing and on refusing. Measured: eleven fills into a 100K
//           window, every turn after the eleventh failed identically, and the
//           hook logged a refusal for each one. The gate cannot be satisfied
//           from inside, because the model cannot be reached to satisfy it.
//
// So the `auto` path in this file exits 0 unconditionally. Not as a fallback,
// and not as a weaker setting: a gate that can wedge the thing it protects is
// worse than no gate, and this one wedges it silently at the exact moment the
// session is most valuable.
//
// The escape, if you ever get there: a manual /compact still works on a wedged
// session, so long as the manual rule allows it. Measured. That is another
// reason the two triggers must never share a verdict.
//
// AND `auto` IS ALSO HOW A SUBAGENT COMPACTS
// A subagent's context compacts independently of yours, `PreCompact` fires for
// it with `trigger: "auto"`, and **the payload does not say it is a subagent**:
// no `agent_id`, no `agent_type`, nothing this hook could read to tell whose
// context it is looking at. `SubagentStart` carries both fields; `PreCompact`
// carries neither.
//
// Measured, with the auto rule set to exit 2: a `general-purpose` subagent
// reading twelve files died with `Agent terminated early due to an API error:
// Prompt is too long`, while the parent session was untouched and reported the
// error. (A subagent can die of that with nothing refusing anything, when one
// tool result crosses the ceiling in a single step and the compaction fires too
// late to help. Refusing is sufficient to kill one, not necessary.)
//
// So a blocking `auto` rule does not merely risk wedging the orchestrator. It
// kills long-running implementation agents, in a repository whose hook settings
// are tracked and therefore reach every worktree. Nothing in this file can
// distinguish that case, which is the second independent reason the rule below
// is unconditional rather than careful.
//
// AND THE FAR SIDE REACHES THEM, WHICH IS WHY THE INJECTED BLOCK IS ADDRESSED
// A subagent's compaction fires `SessionStart` with `source: "compact"` like
// any other, and the stdout lands in *that subagent's* resumed context.
// Measured: three subagent compactions, three injections 0.3s later, in a
// session whose own context never compacted, and the marker came back in the
// agent's report. #124's survey recorded the opposite; ADR 0042 has why, and it
// comes down to a compaction that died before it completed.
//
// So this file talks to an implementation agent every time one compacts in a
// repository where it is wired, and it cannot tell that is who it is talking
// to. See the block above `sessionStart` below.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
// **Telling you that an agent compacted.** Nothing reaches the orchestrator: no
// event, nothing in your transcript, nothing on the Task result. It is on the
// record afterwards, in the agent's own transcript rather than yours, and
// `references/continuity.md` has the command. Keep briefs self-contained, put
// their durable half in the issue so a compacted agent can re-read it, and keep
// dispatches short enough not to find out.
//
// **A handoff nobody wrote.** This file checks a file's age and refuses one
// command over it. Whether the words in it are worth carrying is not a thing a
// hook can see, and the failure this whole mechanism is aimed at — a handoff
// written under pressure that is confidently wrong — looks perfectly fresh from
// here.
//
// **Merges you have not fetched.** The count below reads the local default
// branch, so it is a floor and never a ceiling: work that landed and has not
// been pulled is invisible, and the handoff is staler than this says.
//
// **Whether it is loaded.** See --probe.
